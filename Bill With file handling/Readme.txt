In the item.txt file use have to write in this order:
	
product code->new line->product name->new line->product price->new line->repeat same for the new product.
 
For running the program in any IDE you can keept the "item.txt" file in the project folder.
Butif you want to use the application after complete build then you have to keept the file in the dist
folder inside the project.
